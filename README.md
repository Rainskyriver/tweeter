# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that uses AJAX, jQuery, HTML5, and CSS. You will find that the design doesn't shy far from the specifications, but the small personal touches really give the project a nice flare. (If you don't understand the error messages, they're an Oblivion reference)
